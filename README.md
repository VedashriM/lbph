# Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH)

Local Binary Patterns (LBP) is a type of visual descriptor used for classification in computer vision. LBP was first described in 1994 and has since been found to be a powerful feature for texture classification. It has further been determined that when LBP is combined with the Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) descriptor, it improves the detection performance considerably on some datasets.
